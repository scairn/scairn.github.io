I&amp;rsquo;d describe myself as a life long learner, which is part of the reason why I have made this site. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make an effort to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to both help highlight areas that I need to work on and hopefully help/entertain you the reader.
My career to date has allowed me to accumulate a wide array of knowledge across the data and tech fields.</description></item></channel></rss>
